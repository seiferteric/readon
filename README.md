This is a google chrome extension to find book mentions on the current page and give links to them if they are available for free online.
Just click the extension icon and it should show a list of books it has found.

Currently only supports books on project gutenberg.

Current Issues:
---------------
  - Pretty Slow. It searches the document text 55,000+ times. Once for each book titles when you open the popup
  - Multiple books can have the same name, from different authors/years and it does not know the difference.
  - Some book titles have very short names, like single letters or words and show up a lot when you probably don't want them.
  - Styling of popup could be imporved and probably should include author and published year.
